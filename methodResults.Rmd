#Methods
Differential Expression is mainly used for gene level inference, and the results can be further deployed for other analyses. 
Differential Expression involves two main steps- 
a. estimating the relative abundance of transcript, 
b.and to apply statistical models to test for differential expression between treatment groups. In this particular module, the same steps were followed by using tools like Salmon and then R packages like DESeq2.


1. Initially, Salmon is used to quantify the transcripts in a given file of your RNASeq experiment. It runs in 2 phases- Indexing and Quantification. Indexing phase involves creating a mapping based index on the auxiliary Kmer hash over of length 31. After this step, quantification is done and --validate mappings flag is used to enable selective alignment. 

2. These transcripts are then put in the form of a table. A R script called mergeKo.r is written and Kable is used to put it in a presentable form. Hereafter, the first filtering is done using Swissprot coverage. Then KEGG IDs are matched to these Swissprot IDs, and then BLAST results are merged to this KEGG-Swissprot table. This is done so that analysis using tximport and then DESeq2 can be carried out.

3. Scripts are written to further import the data into DESeq2 and carry out analysis. DESeq2 helps carry out RNASeq analysis by using shrinkage estimation, for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.The two conditions used in this analysis was Menthol vs Vibrio in Aitapsia. Hereon, the filtering is done using padj or p-adjacent value less than 0.05. This gives us a list of both upregulated and down regulated genes in 2 different scenarios (with KEGG Orthology IDs, pathway and Swissprot references).
